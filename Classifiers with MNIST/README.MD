# ECE 175A - Elements of Machine Intelligence
This folder contains the mathematical process and development of supervised and unsupervised classifiers using different metrics taught in ECE 175A at UCSD. It does __not__ contain the source code for the classifiers as it is still used as homework material for the course. For inquiries regarding the source code, please contact me at my personal email kevshin2002@gmail.com. 

The homework dataset uses the MNIST dataset which contains training and testing data for classifiers. Each folder will contain a README detailing which classifiers to view first. Inside of each Classifier folder will contain the homework question as well as the breakdown of the question.

To learn more about the structure of the class, [here](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/courses/ece175/) is the link to the course syllabus along with the lectures and homework problems.
