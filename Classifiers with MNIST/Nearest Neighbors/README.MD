# Nearest Neighbors
The chronological order is Euclidean Distance, Mahalobian Distance, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and then Principal Component Analysis.

It starts off with the most basic metric, and starts increasing the complexity, incorporating probability and optimizations to achieve lower error rates.
